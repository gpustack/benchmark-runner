"""
Output handler for serializing generative benchmark reports to JSON (both summary and full).

This module implements a dual-output JSON handler that saves both:
1. Summary JSON - Excludes large fields like individual requests and detailed metrics
2. Full JSON - Contains complete benchmark data including all requests

Both files are saved to the same directory with clear naming conventions.

This module also aggregates the per-chunk ITL samples that
``openai_http_error_detail_backend`` records, into a distribution shaped exactly
like guidellm's own latency metrics -- see ``ITL_METRIC_KEY`` below.

guidellm 0.7.x note:
- Output formatters are resolved by ``GenerativeBenchmarkerOutput.resolve(args)``
  which looks up the implementation by ``args.kind`` and calls its ``from_args``
  factory. So a custom output needs BOTH a ``BenchmarkOutputArgs`` subclass (the
  spec, registered by kind) AND the ``GenerativeBenchmarkerOutput`` implementation
  (registered by the same kind) implementing ``from_args``.
- Response handlers still live in ``guidellm.backends.openai.request_handlers``
  with ``OpenAIRequestHandlerFactory`` (used by the JSON encoder fallback to map a
  handler class back to its registered name).
