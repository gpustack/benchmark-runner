"""Terminal rendering of a measured load curve.

Two modes produce one: ``--auto-tune`` searches for the load a server should run
at, and ``--stages`` measures a ladder the user wrote out. Both write the evidence
to JSON; this module puts it on screen, so a run ends with a chart and a sentence
instead of a directory of files.

The two are rendered by the same code and deliberately do NOT say the same thing.
A ramp brackets and converges, so it names an operating point. A ladder measured
only the rungs it was handed, so it reports its best rung and whether the ladder
contained a peak at all — reusing "recommended" there would launder the user's own
guess into a finding. See ``best_points`` and ``_verdict``.

Design constraints that shaped it, all of them terminal-specific:

* **Status verdicts are the UI's, not new ones.** ``point_status`` reimplements
  gpustack-ui's ``getStageStatus`` (recommended / peak / overloaded / ok) and the
  glyphs mirror its badges. A CLI that called 32 req/s "healthy" while the web
  report called the same point "overloaded" would be two products.
* **Colour is decoration, never information.** Every verdict is carried by a
  glyph; ANSI is added on top when the stream is a TTY. Piped into a log file or
  a CI job, the chart still says which point is which.
* **The x axis is categorical, not logarithmic.** The ramp doubles in Phase 1 and
  then refines inside the winning bracket, so log-x crushes exactly the points
  that carry the answer (4, 8, 16, 32 spread out; 28, 29, 30, 31 on top of each
  other). Even spacing per measured point is what the web report does too.
* **Latency is log-y.** A run whose top point blew up to 9s would otherwise flatten
  every sub-second point into one row, hiding the knee the chart exists to show.
* **Throughput is zero-based and allowed to look flat.** A plateau IS the finding;
  the marker says which point won, the curve does not have to exaggerate to prove it.
